I have not read many books on spiritual concepts.

I mean I have read alchemical treatises, and various books related to techniques and theory.  But I have never read books regarding states of consciousness.

Why?

Because I never found them useful. And yes I appreciate the irony of someone not finding use in reading about states of consciousness yet writing about them.  Thank you!
